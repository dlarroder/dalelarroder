I am currently a Software Developer at [Aphex](https://aphex.co/),
I was previously a Jr. Backend Developer at Code and Theory Manila,
where I mostly used PHP to create back-end APIs for the front-ends to consume.
But now I am more focused on JavaScript and the front-end side of things
where I am using ReactJS to create beautiful and reusable user interfaces
