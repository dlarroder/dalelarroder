# Sharing assets in your Nx Workspace

## Step 1: Create your shared asset libary

```bash
nx g @nrwl/workspace:lib assets
```

## Step 2: Tell you workspace where your assets will come from

In your `project.json` you can add the following:

```json
"assets": [
  "apps/field-app/src/favicon.ico",
  {
    "glob": "**/*",
    "input": "./libs/assets/css",
    "output": "./"
  },
  {
    "glob": "**/*",
    "input": "./libs/assets/fonts",
    "output": "./fonts"
  },
  {
    "glob": "**/*",
    "input": "./libs/assets/images",
    "output": "./images"
  }
],

```
