# Why does React need keys?

The `key` prop is the only thing React can use to identify components in the DOM when they are
mapped from an array. If no key is provided then you will see an error like this:

```console
Missing “key” prop for element in iterator
```

In that case, React will default to use the index of the element in the array as the key.
Usually, developers will also provide index as the key just to remove the warning.

# Using the index as a key is dangerous

#### Please do NOT do this:

```js
todos.map((todo, index) => (
    <Todo {...todo} key={index} />
  ));
}
```

It is stated in the official React [docs](https://reactjs.org/docs/lists-and-keys.html) that this is not recommended.

> We don’t recommend using indexes for keys if the order of items may change.
> This can negatively impact performance and may cause issues with component state.

Robin Pokorny has an amazing [article](https://robinpokorny.medium.com/index-as-a-key-is-an-anti-pattern-e0349aece318) explaining in detail the negative impacts of using an index as a key.

# Rules of keys

- Keys must be `unique` among siblings. However, it’s okay to use the same keys for JSX nodes
  in different arrays.

- Keys must `not change` or that defeats their purpose! Don’t generate them while rendering.

# Where to get your key

- **Data from a database:** If your data is coming from a database, you can use the database keys/IDs,
  which are unique by nature.

- **Locally generated data:** If your data is generated and persisted locally (e.g. notes in a note-taking app),
  use an incrementing counter, `crypto.randomUUID()` or a package like `uuid` when creating items.

```js
// id must be from db, which are unique by nature.
const todos = [
  {
    id: 22,
    name: 'eat breakfast',
  },
  // ....
]

// Much better
todos.map((todo) => <Todo {...todo} key={todo.id} />)
```

# Conclusion

- Always try to use stable **unique** IDs as the key.
- If the list is **never** reordered or filtered, you can use their index as keys. (As a last resort)
