# Overview

<TOCInline toc={props.toc} exclude="Overview" toHeading={2} />

Authentication and authorization are essential aspects of web application development. In [Laravel](https://laravel.com/), a popular [PHP](https://www.php.net/) framework, these features are not only straightforward to implement but also highly customizable. In this guide, we will explore how to set up authentication and authorization in a Laravel application with practical code examples.

## Laravel Project Setup

### Install Laravel

To get started, make sure you have Composer installed on your system. Then, open your terminal and run the following command to create a new Laravel project:

```bash
composer create-project --prefer-dist laravel/laravel laravel-auth-guide
```

This command will set up a new Laravel project named laravel-auth-guide.

### Database Configuration

Next, configure your database connection by editing the .env file. Set the DB_CONNECTION, DB_HOST, DB_PORT, DB_DATABASE, DB_USERNAME, and DB_PASSWORD variables to match your database setup.

### Part 1: Authentication with Laravel Breeze

Step 1: Setting Up Authentication with Breeze
Laravel Breeze provides a minimal, lightweight authentication scaffolding with Blade views. To set it up, run the following commands:

```bash
composer require laravel/breeze --dev
```

```bash
php artisan breeze:install
```

```bash
 Which Breeze stack would you like to install?
  Blade with Alpine ..................................................................................................................... blade
  React with Inertia .................................................................................................................... react
  Vue with Inertia ........................................................................................................................ vue
  API only ................................................................................................................................ api
❯ blade
blade

  Would you like dark mode support? (yes/no) [no]
❯ no

  Which testing framework do you prefer? [PHPUnit]
  PHPUnit ................................................................................................................................... 0
  Pest ...................................................................................................................................... 1
❯ 0
```

This command will generate login, registration, and password reset views, along with the necessary controllers and routes.

### Step 2: Database Configuration

Make sure your `.env` file is correctly configured to connect to your database. Update the following fields with your database credentials:

```env
DB_CONNECTION=mysql
DB_HOST=127.0.0.1
DB_PORT=3306
DB_DATABASE=your_database_name
DB_USERNAME=your_database_username
DB_PASSWORD=your_database_password
```

```bash
php artisan migrate
```

### Step 3: User Model

Laravel Breeze uses the default User model, which is located in the app directory and extends the `Illuminate\Foundation\Auth\User` class.

### Step 4: Authentication Middleware

The `auth` middleware can be applied to routes that require authentication. In your routes, you can use this middleware to protect specific routes or groups of routes. For example, in your `routes/web.php` file, you can define a route like this:

```php
Route::get('/dashboard', function () {
    return view('dashboard');
})->middleware(['auth'])->name('dashboard');
```

This route is protected, meaning that only authenticated users can access it. If an unauthenticated user tries to access it, they will be redirected to the login page.

### Step 5: Login

To access the login page, you can navigate to `/login` in your web browser. Laravel Breeze has already created the login view and controller for you. You can customize the login view by modifying the `resources/views/auth/login.blade.php` file.

### Conclusion

In this comprehensive guide, we've covered setting up authentication and authorization in a Laravel application. Laravel's built-in tools and conventions make it relatively simple to implement these essential features. However, remember that security is paramount, so always validate and sanitize user inputs to prevent security vulnerabilities.
