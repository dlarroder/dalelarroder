# What is a component library?

A [component library](https://langvad.dev/blog/what-is-a-component-library/) is basically a set of re-usable components. It could be a folder inside your project with
common components used throughout the application. It could be a distributed package on npm. It could also be a part of a bigger design system. A component
library can be small and it can be large. There are no official rules for what a component library means.

Some examples of a component library are: Google's [MUI](https://mui.com/), Alibaba's [Ant Design](https://ant.design/) and IBM's design system [Carbon](https://carbondesignsystem.com/).

# Introduction

I have spent the weekend trying out different guides and tutorials, trying to setup [Storybook](https://storybook.js.org/), [Rollup](https://rollupjs.org/guide/en/), [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/), and
[Jest](https://jestjs.io/) to play nicely together but it was a pain, not to mention I really wanted to make [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) work with this but to no avail.

But behold, I found a package called [TSDX](https://tsdx.io/), it is a zero-config CLI that helps you develop, test, and publish modern TypeScript packages.

In this guide, I'll be creating my component library `playground`, this is where (I'm hoping) I can show off some of the cool component ideas I have to the world and
publish it to [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/) (because I'm cool).

# Getting Started

## Step 1: Initialize project using tsdx

```bash
npx tsdx create playground
```

This will promp you to choose from 3 different options, `basic`, `react`, and `react-with-storybook`.

Please choose `react-with-storybook`

## Step 2: Adding Tailwind

We will need to install `tailwindcss`, `postcss` and `autoprefixer`

```bash
yarn add -D tailwindcss@latest postcss@latest autoprefixer@latest
```

After installing the tailwindcss dependencies, we need to create a `tailwind.config.js` file, to do this just run:

```bash
npx tailwindcss init
```

After generating your `tailwind.config.js` file, you can add the following lines to run
[Just in Time](https://v2.tailwindcss.com/docs/just-in-time-mode) Mode and specify a purge path to purge any unused CSS

```js:tailwind.config.js
module.exports = {
  mode: 'jit',
  purge: ['./src/**/*.{js,jsx,ts,tsx}', './stories/*'],
  ...rest of config
}
```

Next is to create a `tailwind.css` file at the root of your project, you can name it anything you like by the way,
I just want to name it tailwind.css because thats the only styles I'll be needing.

```css:tailwind.css
@tailwind base;
@tailwind components;
@tailwind utilities;
```

After creating your `tailwind.css` file, we need to integrate it with storybook, for this step, we will need to add another
dev dependency `@storybook/addon-postcss`

```bash
yarn add -D @storybook/addon-postcss
```

After installing `@storybook/addon-postcss`, we need to add it to `./storybook/main.js`

```js:./storybook/main.js
module.exports = {
  stories: ['../stories/**/*.stories.@(ts|tsx|js|jsx)'],
  addons: [
    '@storybook/addon-links',
    '@storybook/addon-essentials',
    {
      name: '@storybook/addon-postcss',
      options: {
        postcssLoaderOptions: {
          implementation: require('postcss'),
        },
      },
    },
  ],
  ...rest of config
};
```

And finally, to be able to see our tailwind styles in storybook, we will need to import our `tailwind.css` file in `.storybook/preview.js`

```js:.storybook/preview.js
import '../tailwind.css';
```

We can now test if your tailwind styles are working, lets run storybook

```bash
yarn storybook
```

You can add the following styles in your `src/index.tsx`

```tsx:src/index.tsx
export const Thing: FC<Props> = ({ children }) => {
  return (
    <div className="text-xl text-pink-500 p-4 bg-gray-200 rounded-lg">
      {children || `the snozzberries taste like snozzberries`}
    </div>
  );
};
```

and you should see our tailwind styles working

## Step 3: Setup our build configuration

Because we added Tailwind to our library, we need to include exporting it's styles in
our build config.

Luckily, Tailwind has great documentation, and we can just use it's default configuration from the
[optimizing for production](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/optimizing-for-production) guide docs

In our `package.json` file, we just need to add the following

```json:package.json
"scripts": {
  ... rest of
"build-tailwind": "npx tailwindcss -o ./dist/styles.css --minify"
}
```

And we also need to change our build script to consume our new `build-tailwind` script

```json:package.json
"scripts": {
  ... rest of
  "build": "tsdx build && yarn build-tailwind",
}
```

To check if your build worked, you can run `yarn build` and check if your build has
generated a `styles.css` file in your `dist` folder

```diff:dist/
dist/
index.d.ts
index.js
... rest of config
+styles.css
```

The `styles.css` is important because this is what our package consumers will use for our
styles to take effect in their projects.

## Step 4: Publishing to NPM

First step is to push our code to a Github repo, so just create a new repository
and push your code to Github,

```bash
git init
git remote add origin <repo origin url>
git add .
git commit -m â€œinitial setup
git push origin master
```

Next step is to login to your NPM account via terminal

```bash
npm login
```

This will prompt you to enter your NPM username, password, and email address.

If you don't have an NPM account yet, you can create an account [here](https://www.npmjs.com/signup)

After logging in, we are ready to publish our package, but first, we need to change our
package name to whatever we want, in our case it is called `@dlarroder/playground`

```json:package.json
"name": "@dlarroder/playground",
"author": "Dale Larroder",
"version": "0.0.1",
```

After changing our package.json file, we can now run our build so it will pick up our new package name.

```bash
yarn build
```

After building, we will have our updated `/dist` folder with our new name, we can now run our
final command `npm publish --access public`

```bash
npm publish --access public
```

Boom, you are done! you can now check our NPM account for our new package [@dlarroder/playground](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@dlarroder/playground).

# Conclusion

Building and publishing your own package might sound hard at first, but it is really simple when you've tried it,
you just need to follow some random guide in the internet like this one, (joke) but CLI tools like [tsdx](https://tsdx.io/) really
makes it simple to bootstrap your very own component library. I really had fun creating my playground package and this
guide, hope this helps!

<LinkButton>Fancy Button!</LinkButton>

Fun fact! ^This `<LinkButton />` component is from my playground!
