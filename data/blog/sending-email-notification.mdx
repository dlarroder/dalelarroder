Title: Building a Custom Login and Registration System in Laravel 10

In this article, we'll walk through the process of creating a custom login and registration system in Laravel 10. While Laravel provides built-in authentication with Jetstream and UI packages, there are times when you need to create your own login, registration, dashboard, and logout functionality. We'll cover each step in detail, from setting up the Laravel application to creating the necessary routes, controllers, and views.

# Step 1: Installing Laravel

First, we need to set up a fresh Laravel application. Open your terminal or command prompt and run the following command:

```shell
composer create-project laravel/laravel example-app
```

# Step 2: Database Configuration

Next, configure your database settings in the `.env` file. Add the following details and then run the migration command to create the users table:

```dotenv
DB_CONNECTION=mysql
DB_HOST=127.0.0.1
DB_PORT=3306
DB_DATABASE=laravel9_blog
DB_USERNAME=root
DB_PASSWORD=password
```

Run the migration using:

```shell
php artisan migrate
```

# Step 3: Creating Routes

Now, create custom routes for login, register, home, and logout. Open the `routes/web.php` file and add the following routes:

```php
Route::get('login', [AuthController::class, 'index'])->name('login');
Route::post('post-login', [AuthController::class, 'postLogin'])->name('login.post');
Route::get('registration', [AuthController::class, 'registration'])->name('register');
Route::post('post-registration', [AuthController::class, 'postRegistration'])->name('register.post');
Route::get('dashboard', [AuthController::class, 'dashboard']);
Route::get('logout', [AuthController::class, 'logout'])->name('logout');
```

# Step 4: Creating the Controller

In this step, create the `AuthController` and add the necessary code. The controller handles actions like displaying the login and registration forms, processing login and registration requests, and handling logout.

# Step 5: Creating Blade Files

Create the Blade files for layout, login, register, and home pages. These Blade templates define the structure and content of the respective pages.

- `resources/views/auth/login.blade.php`
- `resources/views/auth/registration.blade.php`
- `resources/views/dashboard.blade.php`
- `resources/views/layout.blade.php`

These Blade files contain HTML markup and form elements necessary for the login, registration, and dashboard pages.

# Running the Laravel App

With all the steps completed, run your Laravel application using the following command:

```shell
php artisan serve
```

You can access your app by visiting http://localhost:8000/login in your web browser.

In summary, this article has guided you through the process of building a custom login and registration system in Laravel 10. By following these steps, you can create your own authentication system tailored to your project's specific requirements.
